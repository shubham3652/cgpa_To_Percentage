# __cgpa_To_Percentage__

A ```JAVA Program``` to find a Percentage out from CGPA (```Printed on your result```).

There are multiple ways to write a program for this topic.

### I wrote it in a ✌️(```two```) ways:
 There are Program files in two different Folders. In which, 
* 📁Program file (```LOOP```)  ♾ 
* 📁Program file (```no_LOOP```)

There are comments over the code so that you can understand it very well.\
Its easy, you will get it.\
I tried to make it as easy as possible to understand.
